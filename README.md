Disclosure: i got a lot of the basic code off the internet,
and it STILL took me two days to get it running.

Don't mess with the code unless you know what you're doing

that being said, this is an open source project
do what you want with it, just rename it if you modify it.

in order to use this program you MUST have python 3 installed. you can get it here: https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.1/python-3.8.1.exe

in order to run it, just run DEVchat.bat
